*We did not follow the format itemized on the demo format, as 3_integration_testing and 4_data_collection did not apply to us. We did not put all coding directories in one folder called 1_code so as to not alter the code, as much of it includes filepaths that shouldn't be altered.* 

The 5_documentation folder holds the following files: 

    technical_documentation.pdf
    user_documentation.pdf
    brochure/flyer.pdf
    presentation_slides.pdf 
    individual_contributions.pdf
